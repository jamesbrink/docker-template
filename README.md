# Essex - Docker boilerplate

## About

The goal of this project is to provide a consistent boilerplate and templates for creating docker projects, or integrating docker into existing projects. It will provide the essential skelton with proper labeling and metadata out of the box and will be powered using a `Makefile` workflow with targets for the essential tasks.

## Goals

 * Allow easy creation of Dockerfiles using best practices
 * Use a `Makefile` driven build workflow
 * Easily maintain consistency between projects using Docker
 * All images will have valid Labels/Annotations. See the Open Container Initiative [image-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/annotations.md)
