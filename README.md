# Essex - Boilerplate for Docker Based Projects

## About

Project is still under active development and may not work as expected.  
**Pull requests always welcome**

Essex is a CLI utility written in bash to quickly setup consistent and clean Docker projects.

## Goals

 * Allow easy creation of Dockerfiles using best practices
 * Use a `Makefile` driven build workflow
 * Easily maintain consistency between projects using that use Docker
 * All images will have valid Labels/Annotations. See the Open Container Initiative [image-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/annotations.md)  


This tool is intended to just lay down a starting point for each project. 
It will still require you to modify the Dockerfile and settings by hand just as you would any other Docker based project.
